The role also reconciles shop floor production and stock records against the ledger, then closes the books and prepares the year end financial statements."

Differences usually come from unrecorded issues to production, scrap not written off, rejections and goods received without an invoice. Each line is cleared with your stores team before the month is closed."

We maintain a component wise fixed asset register with capitalisation dates, additions, disposals and residual value, and keep a separate block wise computation under the Income Tax Act, since the two rarely give the same number."

Your purchase register is matched against GSTR-2B every month, suppliers who have not filed are chased in writing, goods sent for job work are tracked against returns received, and the periodic returns are prepared from that reconciled base."

A single unit with one GSTIN and about 400 vouchers a month sits at the lower end. Costing support, inventory valuation and the monthly MIS pack are quoted on top once we have seen one month of live data."

We review the Tally or ERP data, trial balance, last filed GST and TDS returns and the previous year audited statements, run a health check, hand you a written list of open items, then start live entries from an agreed cut off date."

Zoho Books fits lighter assembly operations. QuickBooks is not an option in India, since Intuit withdrew the product for Indian users in 2023."

Job costing is applied to made to order runs and process costing to continuous output, with inventory valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value under AS 2. Prescribed industries above the notified turnover limits must also maintain cost records under the Companies Act."

            <div class="content-text">
                <div class="highlight-box" style="margin-bottom:20px;">
                    <p><strong>&#128204; TL;DR - Manufacturing Accounting Services at a Glance</strong></p>
                    <p>Manufacturing accounting services value work in progress at BOM level instead of writing factory overheads off as one lump. The ITC-04 job-work return is reconciled to the stock ledger each quarter. Patron maintains the Section 148 cost records specified industries must keep, alongside plant-wise cost sheets and machine-hour absorption rates. Frequently used by units across MIDC and GIDC industrial estates.</p>
                </div>
                <p>One plant generates more paperwork in a month than most service businesses see in a year. Goods receipt notes, material issue slips, job-work challans, scrap sales, e-way bills and production reports all have to reach the ledger before a cost per unit means anything at all. Patron takes those feeds in bulk, posts them against the bill of materials, and closes each month with a variance run. Working out cost per unit is set out separately.</p>
                <p>Cost per unit goes wrong when the stock ledger lags the shop floor, so the workload tracks stock item count, bill-of-materials depth, job-work volume and each plant reporting separately. Costing, the stock ledger and the schedules behind them sit inside scope, with movement data drawn from the e-way bill portal. Cost audit certification, valuation opinions and attendance at the physical count are commissioned apart.</p>

                <div class="content-text what-is-definition">
                    
                    <p>At the close of a manufacturing month, the books have to show one number above all others: what it actually costs to make each unit. Manufacturing accounting services are the discipline that produces that number and stands behind it.</p>
<p>Stock is valued at each stage, raw material, work in progress and finished goods, so factory overheads are absorbed into cost rather than written off as a lump. Each valuation carries the date and the stage it represents. It ties the movement of goods sent out for job work back to the stock ledger, and it maintains the plant-wise cost sheets and machine-hour rates a costed quotation depends on. This function also keeps the cost records that certain notified industries are required to maintain. Accounting for manufacturers, in short, is bookkeeping organised around production rather than around invoices. Cost audit certification, valuation opinions and the physical stock count sit outside this engagement and are commissioned separately.</p>

            <div class="content-text">
                
                <p>Manufacturing accounting services fit plants where the cost of a unit depends on how material, labour and overhead move through the floor. These businesses share one trait. Their books only make sense once production, stock and job work are posted together.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Batch and process plants where yield and scrap shift from one run to the next.</li>
    <li>Units sending <a href="/blog/itc-04-job-work-gst-guide">materials to job workers</a>, needing every challan returned tied to the stock ledger.</li>
    <li>Assembly makers with multi-level bills of material, where one wrong rate distorts every finished good.</li>
    <li>Manufacturers borrowing against stock, whose bank stock statement must agree to the ledger.</li>
    <li>Firms in sectors where cost records are mandatory, needing machine-hour rates maintained monthly.</li>
    <li>Multi-plant units where each factory reports separately and consolidation hides where margin leaks.</li>
    <li>MSME suppliers caught by the <a href="/blog/section-43bh-msme-payment-rule">43B(h) 45-day payment rule</a> on what they owe vendors.</li>
    <li>Foundries and engineering shops with heavy scrap, where abnormal loss must stay out of cost.</li>

Cost records close alongside the year-end. Patron maps input movement and <a href="/blog/itc-04-job-work-gst-guide">job-work accounting</a> to each due date so credit on goods sent out is never lost.

            <div class="content-text">
                
                <p>The record the statute insists exists in a factory is the cost record - the traceable link between raw material, work in progress and finished goods - and Section 148 of the Companies Act 2013 is where that demand originates for notified industries. Above it sits the ordinary company framework, but the manufacturing overlay is what makes these books distinct.</p>
<p>Two figures carry most of the risk: the value of inventory at the year end and the cost of the plant that made it. Both are measured under accounting standards and then re-measured under tax law, so <a href="/glossary/work-in-progress-wip-valuation">Work-in-Progress (WIP) Valuation</a> and the split between <a href="/glossary/direct-vs-indirect-factory-overheads">Direct vs Indirect Factory Overheads</a> are not accounting niceties but the inputs to a cost audit. Manufacturing accounting services keep the stock ledger, the fixed-asset register and the GST credit records tied together against the provisions below.</p>
<ul class="al-list"><li><span class="al-t"><strong>Section 148, Companies Act 2013 with the Companies (Cost Records and Audit) Rules 2014</strong></span><span class="al-d">Notified manufacturers maintain cost records and, above the thresholds, undergo a cost audit reported in Form CRA-3.

<p class="compliance-note"><strong>Practical note:</strong> cost records are often written up too late; the CRA-3 cost audit then surfaces gaps that should have been captured month by month.</p><p style="margin-top:20px;padding-top:16px;border-top:1px solid var(--gray-200);font-size:13px;color:var(--text-muted);"><strong>Official sources:</strong> <a href="https://www.mca.gov.in" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ministry of Corporate Affairs</a> &middot; <a href="https://www.incometax.gov.in" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Income Tax Department</a> &middot; <a href="https://www.gst.gov.in" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GST Portal</a> &middot; <a href="https://www.startupindia.gov.in" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Startup India (DPIIT)</a></p>

  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">What does a manufacturing accountant do?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>A manufacturing accountant maintains the cost and financial records of a factory, covering raw material and stores accounting, work in progress and finished goods valuation, unit costing, GST and TDS workings, the fixed asset register, payroll entries and monthly MIS. The role also reconciles shop floor production and stock records against the ledger, then closes the books and prepares the year end financial statements.</p></div>
</div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">How do you value raw material, work in progress and finished goods?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value under AS 2, with cost built from material, conversion labour and a normal allocation of factory overhead. We agree the basis at the start, either job costing for made to order runs or process costing for continuous output, and apply it consistently so margins stay comparable month to month.</p></div>
</div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">Can plant inventory records be reconciled with the books?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Yes, physical stock records, bin cards and production reports are reconciled against the stock ledger every month and the variance is reported item by item. Differences usually come from unrecorded issues to production, scrap not written off, rejections and goods received without an invoice.

  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">How is depreciation on plant and machinery calculated for a factory?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Depreciation is computed on the useful life prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies Act, adjusted where your plant runs double or triple shifts. We maintain a component wise fixed asset register with capitalisation dates, additions, disposals and residual value, and keep a separate block wise computation under the Income Tax Act, since the two rarely give the same number.</p></div>
</div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">What GST issues come up for manufacturers and how do you handle them?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Manufacturers most often struggle with input tax credit mismatches, job work movement, e-way bill discipline and credit treatment on scrap and free samples. Your purchase register is matched against GSTR-2B every month, suppliers who have not filed are chased in writing, goods sent for job work are tracked against returns received, and the periodic returns are prepared from that reconciled base.</p></div>
</div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">How do you account for goods sent out for job work?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Goods sent for job work remain your inventory and are tracked in a separate job work register carrying challan reference, quantity sent, quantity received back and process loss. The job worker charges are booked as conversion cost, TDS is deducted on the processing bill, and the return timelines under GST are monitored so that credit is not put at risk.</p></div>
</div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">What do manufacturing accounting services cost each month?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Manufacturing accounting typically costs Rs 15,000 to Rs 60,000 a month, depending on voucher volume, number of SKUs, plants and GST registrations. A single unit with one GSTIN and about 400 vouchers a month sits at the lower end. Costing support, inventory valuation and the monthly MIS pack are quoted on top once we have seen one month of live data.</p></div>
</div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">How long does handover of manufacturing books from an existing accountant take?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Takeover normally takes 10 to 15 working days from the day we receive your data backup. We review the Tally or ERP data, trial balance, last filed GST and TDS returns and the previous year audited statements, run a health check, hand you a written list of open items, then start live entries from an agreed cut off date.</p></div>
</div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">Which accounting software is best for a manufacturing company?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Tally Prime suits most Indian manufacturers because it handles stock, batch, job work and GST returns natively, while multi plant units with heavy bill of material and shop floor needs are better on an ERP such as SAP Business One or Odoo. Zoho Books fits lighter assembly operations. QuickBooks is not an option in India, since Intuit withdrew the product for Indian users in 2023.</p></div>
</div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">What type of accounting is used in manufacturing?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Manufacturing uses cost accounting run alongside standard financial accounting, so the same transactions produce both statutory accounts and a per unit cost. Job costing is applied to made to order runs and process costing to continuous output, with inventory valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value under AS 2. Prescribed industries above the notified turnover limits must also maintain cost records under the Companies Act.</p></div>

                <p><strong>Quick Answers</strong></p>
                <p>One plant generates more paperwork in a month than most service businesses see in a year. Goods receipt notes, material issue slips, job-work challans, scrap sales, e-way bills and production reports all have to reach the ledger before a cost per unit means anything at all. Patron takes those feeds in bulk, posts them.</p>

                <p style="color:rgba(255,255,255,0.88);">Your largest buyer demands a rate revision, and the gap shows immediately. Nobody in the room can prove what the item costs to make, and the quotation goes out on a number carried forward from last year. Sometimes it is a second shed instead, or a lender asking for cost line by line.</p>
<p style="color:rgba(255,255,255,0.88);">Accounting for manufacturers moves shop floor numbers into the middle of the month rather than the year end. Consumption against standard, scrap against yield and stock against what the floor reports arrive already tied together. The meeting then turns on why a figure moved instead of whether it is real.</p>
<p style="color:rgba(255,255,255,0.88);">What nobody can answer yet is where your production data actually sits. Issue slips and receipt notes may reach a system, or only a register. We also settle who owns the stock ledger, and how <a href="/accounting-services-it-saas">a software or subscription arm</a> is treated if you run one.</p>
