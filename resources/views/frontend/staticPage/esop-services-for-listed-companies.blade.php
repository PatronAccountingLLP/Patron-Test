These sit alongside the Companies Act and require a shareholder special resolution, prescribed disclosures, and compliance with SEBI LODR and the insider-trading code. The SBEB Regulations are the master framework for any share-based benefit at a listed company." }

The condition is that the benefits were granted at least one year before the draft red herring prospectus was filed, subject to the scheme terms and applicable law." }

                "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Aam taur par nahi, SBEB Regulations promoters ko ESOP se bar karte hain. Lekin Regulation 9A ke baad, agar founder ko promoter classify kiya gaya DRHP mein, aur ESOP DRHP filing se kam se kam ek saal pehle grant hua tha, to wo retain aur exercise kar sakta hai. Yeh ek saal ka cooling-off safeguard hai." }

                "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Founders are often granted ESOPs as employees and then reclassified as promoters when the company files for an IPO, at which point the promoter bar would strip those benefits. Regulation 9A, following a March 2025 consultation and the high-profile Paytm founder case, resolves this by letting pre-IPO founder ESOPs survive reclassification, with a one-year cooling-off period that protects investors while preserving legitimate long-term incentives." }

                "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "A listed company discloses its ESOP scheme and grant details when adopting the scheme by special resolution, makes event-based disclosures to the stock exchanges under SEBI LODR, and prepares annual ESOP disclosures and board-report statements each year. Administration must also respect the SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading code, particularly around exercise windows. Our annual disclosure and reporting service handles these filings." }

                "@type": "Question",
                "name": "How is a listed-company ESOP different from an unlisted one?",
                "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "A listed-company ESOP is governed by the SEBI SBEB Regulations 2021 with LODR disclosures and the insider-trading code, on top of the Companies Act. An unlisted company follows mainly the Companies Act and Section 62, with ROC filings and no SEBI layer. Promoters are barred in both, but the carve-outs differ: Regulation 9A for listed companies at IPO, and the DPIIT-startup exemption for unlisted companies." }

                "name": "ESOP scheme ke liye shareholder approval chahiye kya?",
                "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Haan. Listed company mein ESOP scheme adopt ya vary karne ke liye shareholders ka special resolution chahiye, prescribed disclosures ke saath. Yeh SBEB Regulations ki requirement hai. Iske baad LODR disclosures aur annual reporting bhi karni hoti hai." }

                "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes. The SEBI SBEB Regulations 2021 are a single framework covering ESOPs, stock appreciation rights, sweat equity and employee benefit trusts for listed companies. Regulation 9A itself refers to ESOPs, SARs and similar benefits. So a listed company structuring any share-based incentive, not only a classic ESOP, looks to the SBEB Regulations for the rules on approval, administration and disclosure." }

                    <p><strong>&#128204; TL;DR - Listed-Company ESOP Services at a Glance</strong></p>
                    <p>Listed-company ESOPs are governed by the SEBI SBEB Regulations 2021, with the new Regulation 9A clarifying founder ESOPs at IPO. We handle scheme, approvals, disclosure and reporting; engagements are quoted.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Listed-company ESOPs live under the SEBI SBEB Regulations, not just the Companies Act, and the bar for compliance is high. Patron Accounting runs your listed-company ESOP end to end: scheme design, SEBI SBEB and Regulation 9A compliance, shareholder approvals, LODR disclosure and annual reporting.</p>
                <p>For a listed company, an ESOP is a SEBI matter as much as a Companies Act one. The SBEB Regulations govern how schemes are framed, approved, disclosed and administered, and the recent Regulation 9A resolves a long-standing question on founder ESOPs at IPO. We run the whole programme for your board and secretarial team.</p>
                <p>Content is reviewed quarterly for accuracy.</p>

They sit alongside the Companies Act, not instead of it.</p>
                    <p>The Regulations require a shareholder special resolution to adopt or vary a scheme, set rules for administration through a compensation committee or a trust, prescribe disclosures, and bar promoters and promoter-group members from ESOPs, subject to the new Regulation 9A carve-out. Listed companies also disclose under SEBI LODR and operate within the SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading code.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box" style="margin-bottom:16px;">
                    <p><strong>Regulation 9A in brief (notified 8 September 2025)</strong></p>
                    <p>An employee later identified as a promoter or promoter-group member in the draft offer document may retain and exercise ESOPs, SARs or similar benefits, provided they were granted at least one year before the draft red herring prospectus was filed, and subject to the scheme terms and applicable law.</p>
                </div>
                <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> founders are often granted ESOPs as employees, then reclassified as promoters when the company files for an IPO, at which point the promoter bar would otherwise strip those benefits. Regulation 9A closes that gap with a one-year cooling-off safeguard.</p>
                <p><strong>The background:</strong> the amendment followed a March 2025 consultation paper and the high-profile Paytm founder case, settled in May 2025 with a surrender of about 21 million ESOPs and a three-year ban, which made the need for clarity acute. We help IPO-bound and newly listed companies apply Regulation 9A correctly to founder grants.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">What regulations govern ESOPs for listed companies?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Listed-company ESOPs are governed primarily by the SEBI (Share Based Employee Benefits and Sweat Equity) Regulations 2021, which cover ESOPs, stock appreciation rights, sweat equity and employee benefit trusts. These sit alongside the Companies Act and require a shareholder special resolution, prescribed disclosures, and compliance with SEBI LODR and the insider-trading code. The SBEB Regulations are the master framework for any share-based benefit at a listed company.</p></div>

                        <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">What is Regulation 9A of the SBEB Regulations?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Regulation 9A, inserted by the SEBI SBEB Amendment Regulations 2025 and notified on 8 September 2025, allows an employee who is later identified as a promoter or promoter-group member in the draft offer document to retain and exercise ESOPs, SARs or similar benefits. The condition is that the benefits were granted at least one year before the draft red herring prospectus was filed, subject to the scheme terms and applicable law.</p></div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item" id="faq-3">
                        <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">Listed company mein promoter ESOP rakh sakta hai kya?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Aam taur par nahi, SBEB Regulations promoters ko ESOP se bar karte hain. Lekin Regulation 9A ke baad, agar founder ko promoter classify kiya gaya DRHP mein, aur ESOP DRHP filing se kam se kam ek saal pehle grant hua tha, to wo retain aur exercise kar sakta hai. Yeh ek saal ka cooling-off safeguard hai.</p></div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item" id="faq-4">
                        <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">Why was Regulation 9A introduced?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Founders are often granted ESOPs as employees and then reclassified as promoters when the company files for an IPO, at which point the promoter bar would strip those benefits. Regulation 9A, following a March 2025 consultation and the high-profile Paytm founder case, resolves this by letting pre-IPO founder ESOPs survive reclassification, with a one-year cooling-off period that protects investors while preserving legitimate long-term incentives.</p></div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item" id="faq-5">
                        <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">What disclosures does a listed company make for ESOPs?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>A listed company discloses its ESOP scheme and grant details when adopting the scheme by special resolution, makes event-based disclosures to the stock exchanges under SEBI LODR, and prepares annual ESOP disclosures and board-report statements each year. Administration must also respect the SEBI Prohibition of Insider Trading code, particularly around exercise windows. Our annual disclosure and reporting service handles these filings.</p></div>

                    <div class="faq-expanded__item" id="faq-6">
                        <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">How is a listed-company ESOP different from an unlisted one?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>A listed-company ESOP is governed by the SEBI SBEB Regulations 2021 with LODR disclosures and the insider-trading code, on top of the Companies Act. An unlisted company follows mainly the Companies Act and Section 62, with ROC filings and no SEBI layer. Promoters are barred in both, but the carve-outs differ: Regulation 9A for listed companies at IPO, and the DPIIT-startup exemption for unlisted companies.</p></div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item" id="faq-7">
                        <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">ESOP scheme ke liye shareholder approval chahiye kya?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Haan. Listed company mein ESOP scheme adopt ya vary karne ke liye shareholders ka special resolution chahiye, prescribed disclosures ke saath. Yeh SBEB Regulations ki requirement hai. Iske baad LODR disclosures aur annual reporting bhi karni hoti hai.</p></div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item" id="faq-8">
                        <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">Do the SBEB Regulations cover SARs and sweat equity too?</h3>
                        <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Yes. The SEBI SBEB Regulations 2021 are a single framework covering ESOPs, stock appreciation rights, sweat equity and employee benefit trusts for listed companies. Regulation 9A itself refers to ESOPs, SARs and similar benefits. So a listed company structuring any share-based incentive, not only a classic ESOP, looks to the SBEB Regulations for the rules on approval, administration and disclosure.</p></div>

                <p>For IPO-bound companies, the Regulation 9A one-year rule is measured from the DRHP filing, so founder grants must be in place well before the company decides to list. Structure founder ESOPs early, and keep the scheme and disclosures SBEB-compliant throughout, so the incentives survive the move to a listed, promoter-classified world.</p>
