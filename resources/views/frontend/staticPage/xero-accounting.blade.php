            <h2 class="section-title">What Xero Accounting Covers — Scope, Deliverables and Who It Suits</h2>
            <div class="content-text">
                <div class="highlight-box" style="margin-bottom:20px;">
                    <p><strong>&#128204; TL;DR - Xero Accounting Services at a Glance</strong></p>
                    <p>Xero bookkeeping services need Indian adaptation: a GST bridge, TDS tracking and multi-currency handled outside the platform's defaults. Reporting is mapped back to Schedule III for statutory use. Patron runs the daily ledger, <a href="/blog/xero-bank-feeds-reconciliation">bank rules and reconciliation</a> inside Xero while keeping Rule 3(1) edit-log evidence intact. Typically chosen by India-export businesses and Indian arms of global parents.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Your bank feed sets the pace week to week. It is cleared daily, new payees are coded the day they first appear, and foreign receipts are booked at the transaction-date rate, with the movement on receipt taken as an exchange difference. In close week the ledger is mapped to Schedule III, TDS workings are drawn off, comparatives are checked and the period is locked against further edits. Running a cloud ledger across currencies follows this same pattern month after month.</p>
                <p>Transaction count, the currencies carried and the spread of bank and payment gateway feeds are what set the scale. A Xero setup carrying the GST bridge, TDS tracking and Schedule III mapping takes longer to stand up than a plain one. Monthly bookkeeping, reconciliation and the reporting pack are included in the retainer. Statutory audit and government e-invoicing portal integration are not part of the monthly scope.</p>

                <div class="content-text what-is-definition">
                    
                    <p>A cloud ledger stays reliable only while someone owns it day to day. Xero bookkeeping services are the outsourced engagement that does that, keeping a company&#x27;s accounts inside the Xero platform with one team answerable for the ledger staying accurate and current. The work is the routine record itself: bank lines coded, sales and purchases entered, payables and receivables tracked, and accounts reconciled each period. The monthly figures are drawn from the software rather than a spreadsheet maintained alongside it.</p>
<p>Running the ledger live and online is what sets the platform apart, so the books reflect the bank within a day rather than only at month-end. A Xero setup for an Indian business must build the GST tax rates and reporting formats by hand, since the global edition includes none. Because the record stays continuous, xero bookkeeping services move the emphasis from data entry towards review. A miscoding or a missing bill is caught while the month is still open, not after it has closed. The result is a set of books read from the platform, not rebuilt from it.</p>

                <p>Xero bookkeeping services suit Indian businesses that live in a cloud ledger yet still have to satisfy GST, TDS and Schedule III. The platform does none of these on its own. Most face outward: exporters and the local entities of overseas groups.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Indian subsidiaries of a foreign parent that keeps its group books on Xero and expects India to match.</li>
    <li>Exporters billing overseas clients who want one cloud ledger instead of a spread of currency spreadsheets.</li>
    <li>Businesses moving onto the platform for the first time and needing an India organisation set up from scratch.</li>
    <li>Companies whose parent abroad wants to log in and read the India numbers directly.</li>
    <li>Global-facing SMEs whose Indian bank statements cannot auto-feed and must be imported into the ledger instead.</li>
    <li>Firms that need <a href="/blog/xero-for-indian-businesses-gst">GST and TDS handled around Xero</a>, since it does not do them natively.</li>
    <li>Owner-run exporters weighing <a href="/blog/xero-vs-zoho-books-comparison">Xero against Zoho Books</a> before committing their India ledger to one.</li>

            <h2 class="section-title">Legal and Regulatory Framework for Xero Accounting</h2>
            <div class="content-text">
                
                <p>A cloud ledger becomes statutory infrastructure the moment one rule is met: Rule 3(1) of the Companies (Accounts) Rules demands an unbroken, always-on edit log. Section 128 then requires the same eight-year retention of the records, wherever the platform's servers sit.</p>
<p>So running a company's accounts inside Xero is a compliance responsibility, not just a subscription. The records have to stay accessible and legible, the invoices have to meet the Indian tax-invoice rules, and above the turnover limit an IRN has to be raised through the e-invoice portal. That is why <a href="/glossary/xero-bank-rules">Xero Bank Rules</a> and <a href="/glossary/hubdoc-automation">Hubdoc Automation</a> are set up to keep the trail clean, and <a href="/glossary/multi-currency-bank-feed">Multi-Currency Bank Feed</a> to keep foreign receipts reconciled. Xero bookkeeping services answer to the provisions below.</p>
<ul class="al-list"><li><span class="al-t"><strong>Rule 3(1), Companies (Accounts) Rules 2014</strong></span><span class="al-d">The platform keeps an audit trail of every change with its date, switched on all year and never disabled - the hard test any tool must pass.</span></li><li><span class="al-t"><strong>Rule 3, Companies (Accounts) Rules 2014 with Section 128(1)</strong></span><span class="al-d">Books held electronically remain accessible in India, legible and backed up, and retrievable for the eight-year retention period.</span></li><li><span class="al-t"><strong>Section 31 with Rule 48, CGST Act 2017</strong></span><span class="al-d">Invoicing carries the prescribed tax-invoice fields, and above Rs 5 crore turnover an IRN is generated through the e-invoice portal.</span></li><li><span class="al-t"><strong>Section 128(5), Companies Act 2013</strong></span><span class="al-d">The ledger and its vouchers are preserved for eight years, so an export or a re-subscription cannot break the historical trail.</span></li><li><span class="al-t"><strong>Section 44AA, Income-tax Act 1961</strong></span><span class="al-d">The obligation to keep complete books applies to whichever entity runs the platform, company or non-corporate alike.

                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">How do you set up Xero for a business in India?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Xero setup takes 5 to 10 working days and covers organisation settings, financial year and base currency, a chart of accounts aligned to your reporting, GST tracked through custom tax rates, conversion balances as on the chosen start date and user roles. Open invoices and bills are imported so month one begins from a matched trial balance.</p></div>
</div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">How do you set up bank feeds in Xero?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Bank feeds in Xero are set up either as a direct feed where the bank supports it, or as scheduled statement imports in CSV or OFX where it does not, which is the usual position for Indian bank accounts. Once running, statement lines arrive daily and reconciliation rules match recurring payments and receipts automatically.</p></div>
</div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">How do you set up payroll in Xero for Indian staff?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Xero has no India payroll module, so Indian payroll cannot be run inside Xero the way it is in the United Kingdom or Australia. Salaries are processed on an Indian payroll system that handles provident fund, ESI, professional tax and TDS under Section 192, and the monthly payroll journal with employee cost splits is posted into Xero.</p></div>
</div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">Can Xero handle Indian GST returns?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Xero can track GST through custom tax rates and produce the sales and purchase data you need, but it does not file GSTR-1 or GSTR-3B because it has no India return module. We prepare the returns from Xero data, reconcile them against GSTR-2B and file on the GST portal, keeping the working papers with the ledger.</p></div>
</div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">How much does Xero bookkeeping cost?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Xero bookkeeping in India generally costs Rs 10,000 to Rs 25,000 a month for up to about 200 transactions, and Rs 30,000 to Rs 55,000 where multi currency, payroll journals and GST return filing are in scope. The Xero subscription itself is billed by Xero in your own company's name and is separate, as is any one time setup or Tally migration.</p></div>
</div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">Is Xero the same as Tally?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>No. Xero is a cloud ledger built around bank feed reconciliation, multi currency invoicing and access from any device, while Tally is a desktop first Indian package with native GST return formats, e-invoice and e-way bill support and deeper inventory handling. Xero carries no India GST filing module and no India payroll, so returns are prepared and filed outside the software from Xero data.</p></div>
</div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">Can books be migrated from Tally to Xero?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Yes, a Tally to Xero migration takes 2 to 4 weeks and moves masters, opening balances, open invoices and open bills as on the conversion date, with historical years archived as PDF and Excel exports. The chart of accounts is rebuilt to suit Xero rather than copied across, and the trial balance is signed off before go live.</p></div>
</div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">Is Xero a good fit for an Indian company with overseas clients?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Xero suits Indian companies billing overseas because it handles multi currency invoicing, exchange gain and loss on settlement, and reporting in a foreign parent's currency. It is the usual choice for Indian subsidiaries of United Kingdom, Australian and New Zealand groups, where the parent already reports in Xero and wants consolidation without anyone rekeying figures.</p></div>
</div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">How often are Xero books closed and reported?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Books are closed monthly and your reporting pack lands within 7 working days of month end. It carries the P&L and balance sheet, a cash flow view, debtor and creditor ageing, and a GST summary reconciled to the returns filed. Xero is then locked for the period, so nobody can post back into a closed month without an approved adjustment journal.</p></div>
</div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">Does Xero offer bookkeeping services?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>No, Xero sells accounting software only and does not do your bookkeeping, so daily entry, bank reconciliation, GST and TDS work must be handled by your own team or by an accounting firm added to the file as a user. We run that layer inside your Xero organisation, close the books monthly and file the Indian returns Xero itself cannot file.</p></div>

                <p>Your bank feed sets the pace week to week. It is cleared daily, new payees are coded the day they first appear, and foreign receipts are booked at the transaction-date rate, with the movement on receipt taken as an exchange difference. In close week the ledger is mapped to Schedule III, TDS workings are drawn off,.</p>

                <p style="color:rgba(255,255,255,0.88);">Month-end stops being a scramble through spreadsheets exported out of the ledger. With Xero bookkeeping services running underneath, your monthly numbers arrive in the same shape each period, the foreign currency balances already restated. Questions from your group finance team are answered from the ledger itself rather than rebuilt by hand each time.</p>
<p style="color:rgba(255,255,255,0.88);">A decision on holding foreign receipts in the currency account instead of converting on arrival needs a reliable view of realised and unrealised exchange movement. A considered Xero setup carries that view in the ledger, and lets a parent close its own books without waiting on a reconciliation memo from India.</p>
<p style="color:rgba(255,255,255,0.88);">Which subscription tier you hold is the question we start on, along with whether multi-currency is switched on and who holds adviser access today. Where a parent abroad wants a read-only login, or <a href="/zoho-books-accounting">running the ledger in Zoho Books</a> is being weighed, that is settled then.</p>
