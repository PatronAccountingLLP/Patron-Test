        "text": "Setup covers organisation and GST profile configuration, chart of accounts design, customer, vendor and item masters, opening balances from the last audited trial balance, tax rates with HSN or SAC codes, invoice templates, bank feeds, user roles and approval workflows. It closes with a reconciled opening balance sheet and a short handover note so your team can operate the system confidently."

        "text": "A standard Zoho Books implementation takes 2 to 3 weeks for a single entity, and 4 to 6 weeks where multiple GSTINs, inventory, payroll or an e-commerce integration are involved. Week one covers design and master data, week two covers opening balances and integrations, and the final stretch is a parallel run with staff training before the old system is switched off."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Most Indian SMEs run on the Standard or Professional plan, and Professional becomes necessary once you need purchase orders, multi currency, inventory tracking or more than three users. Zoho also offers a free plan for very small businesses under a turnover limit it sets. Licence fees go to Zoho directly and sit outside our implementation and monthly accounting fees."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes. A Tally to Zoho Books migration moves masters, opening balances and usually two years of transaction history, mapped ledger by ledger so reports stay comparable year on year. The work runs 3 to 4 weeks including a parallel month where both systems are maintained, and it closes only once the trial balance, GST turnover and stock values agree in both."

        "text": "Zoho Books is built for Indian GST and generates GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B data, supports e-invoicing through the Invoice Registration Portal and e-way bill generation, and pulls GSTR-2B for input credit matching. Filing still needs human review, because credit mismatches and supplier non filing have to be resolved outside the software before the return is submitted on the GST portal."

Zoho Books supports automatic bank feeds from most major Indian banks, connects to Razorpay, Stripe and PayPal for collections, and integrates with Shopify, Amazon and WooCommerce through native or third party connectors. Marketplace settlements are imported at gross value with commission, shipping and tax collected at source recorded separately, so revenue is never understated."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Intuit withdrew QuickBooks from India in 2023 and support for Indian subscribers ended, so the practical route is migration to another platform, most commonly Zoho Books. We export your masters, balances and transaction history, map the chart of accounts, rebuild the GST settings for Indian rules and reconcile the opening trial balance before go live. Old data is archived in readable form."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Either model works. Many clients take a full monthly retainer where our team posts entries, reconciles banks, files GST and TDS and issues the MIS, typically from Rs 8,000 a month. Others keep data entry in house and use us for month end review, reconciliation and compliance. The access model is fixed at onboarding with role based Zoho Books users on each side."

        "text": "Training is two live sessions of about 90 minutes each, one covering invoicing and expense entry and one covering reports, banking and approvals, followed by a recorded walkthrough and a written process note specific to your setup. Post go live support runs for 30 days over chat and call, after which support continues within the monthly retainer."

Choose Tally Prime if you carry complex inventory with godown level tracking, have an established in house entry team and prefer an offline file. Zoho Books usually costs less overall once hosting and licence renewals are counted."

            <div class="content-text">
                <div class="highlight-box" style="margin-bottom:20px;">
                    <p><strong>&#128204; TL;DR - Zoho Books Accounting Services at a Glance</strong></p>
                    <p>A Zoho Books accountant configures the platform for Indian statutory reporting rather than its global default. Patron sets up <a href="/glossary/zoho-gstin-mapping">GSTIN mapping</a>, e-invoicing, TDS and place-of-supply rules so returns file straight from the ledger. E-invoicing is switched on where turnover crosses the Rs 5 crore threshold, and your team is trained with an SOP pack handed over. Ideal where the platform is new, or not yet set up for Indian compliance.</p>
                </div>
                <p>A ledger left on default settings produces returns that will not reconcile: tax rates sit on the wrong heads, credit notes lose their link to the original invoice, and the outward supply upload fails validation at the portal. So the work is configuration first and routine second. Masters are corrected, historical entries reclassified and a full test cycle run before anyone goes live, as our step-by-step configuration guide describes.</p>
                <p>Wrong place-of-supply tagging surfaces as blocked credit for your customer and a mismatch notice for you, so cleaning up past entries drives effort far more than headcount does. Ongoing zoho books support covers user queries, month-end review and rate changes; registration at the government e-invoicing portal and custom integrations with your billing systems sit outside this retainer.</p>

                <div class="content-text what-is-definition">
                    
                    <p>A Zoho Books accountant is often assumed to be the same as any bookkeeper who happens to open the software, but the two roles diverge at the setup. A general bookkeeper records transactions in whatever the ledger already is. This role first makes the ledger produce correct output, then keeps it that way, because the platform&#x27;s Indian tax behaviour depends on how its masters are set up. The difference shows up the first time a return will not file from the ledger as it stands.</p>
<p>The engagement therefore has two layers. One is configuration: tax heads, place-of-supply logic and document numbering set so the software, not a side spreadsheet, becomes the record of authority. The other is the ongoing month, with entries booked, accounts reconciled and reports read straight from Zoho Books. Zoho Books support covers the running queries and periodic review that keep that configuration intact as rates and rules change. Handled this way, a Zoho Books accountant leaves the software itself trustworthy, rather than a record corrected on export every cycle.</p>

    <li>Businesses that have just crossed the e-invoicing turnover threshold on the platform.</li>
    <li>Interstate sellers whose outward supplies need correct place-of-supply and <a href="/glossary/zoho-gstin-mapping">GSTIN mapping</a> done.</li>
    <li>Vendor-heavy firms that must capture TDS on bills inside the ledger.</li>
    <li>Businesses still matching GSTR-2B outside Zoho in a monthly spreadsheet exercise.</li>

            <h2 class="section-title">Legal and Regulatory Framework for Zoho Books Accounting</h2>
            <div class="content-text">
                
                <p>A single sale sits two ways in Zoho Books: an accounting entry measured under the standards and a GST supply reported under the CGST Act, and the setup has to make one transaction serve both. The provision that makes the software itself accountable is Rule 3(1) - an audit trail that stays on all year.</p>
<p>So a well-run Zoho file is a compliance build, not a login. The GSTIN and the tax rates have to be mapped correctly, the records have to stay retrievable for eight years, and invoicing has to meet the tax-invoice rules with an IRN above the threshold. That is why <a href="/glossary/zoho-gstin-mapping">Zoho GSTIN Mapping</a> and reconciled <a href="/glossary/zoho-banking-feeds">Zoho Banking Feeds</a> are what keep the books filed-ready. A Zoho Books accountant configures and maintains that against the provisions below.</p>
<ul class="al-list"><li><span class="al-t"><strong>Rule 3(1), Companies (Accounts) Rules 2014</strong></span><span class="al-d">The software keeps an audit trail of every change with its date, switched on all year - the single hard test the tool must pass.</span></li><li><span class="al-t"><strong>Section 31 with Rule 48, CGST Act 2017</strong></span><span class="al-d">Invoicing carries the prescribed tax-invoice fields and, above Rs 5 crore turnover, generates an IRN through the e-invoice portal.</span></li><li><span class="al-t"><strong>Rule 3, Companies (Accounts) Rules 2014 with Section 128(1)</strong></span><span class="al-d">Books held electronically remain accessible in India, legible and backed up, and retrievable for eight years - aided by <a href="/glossary/zoho-custom-modules">Zoho Custom Modules</a> where the standard schema falls short.</span></li><li><span class="al-t"><strong>Section 128(5), Companies Act 2013</strong></span><span class="al-d">The ledger and its vouchers are preserved for eight years, so a plan change or an export cannot break the historical trail.</span></li><li><span class="al-t"><strong>Section 44AA, Income-tax Act 1961</strong></span><span class="al-d">The obligation to keep complete books applies to whichever entity runs the file, company or non-corporate alike.

                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">What is included in Zoho Books setup for an Indian business?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Setup covers organisation and GST profile configuration, chart of accounts design, customer, vendor and item masters, opening balances from the last audited trial balance, tax rates with HSN or SAC codes, invoice templates, bank feeds, user roles and approval workflows. It closes with a reconciled opening balance sheet and a short handover note so your team can operate the system confidently.</p></div>
</div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">How long does a Zoho Books implementation take?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>A standard Zoho Books implementation takes 2 to 3 weeks for a single entity, and 4 to 6 weeks where multiple GSTINs, inventory, payroll or an e-commerce integration are involved. Week one covers design and master data, week two covers opening balances and integrations, and the final stretch is a parallel run with staff training before the old system is switched off.</p></div>
</div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">Which Zoho Books plan is needed and what does the licence cost?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Most Indian SMEs run on the Standard or Professional plan, and Professional becomes necessary once you need purchase orders, multi currency, inventory tracking or more than three users. Zoho also offers a free plan for very small businesses under a turnover limit it sets. Licence fees go to Zoho directly and sit outside our implementation and monthly accounting fees.</p></div>
</div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">Can existing Tally data be migrated into Zoho Books?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Yes. A Tally to Zoho Books migration moves masters, opening balances and usually two years of transaction history, mapped ledger by ledger so reports stay comparable year on year. The work runs 3 to 4 weeks including a parallel month where both systems are maintained, and it closes only once the trial balance, GST turnover and stock values agree in both.</p></div>
</div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">Does Zoho Books handle GST returns and e-invoicing for India?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Zoho Books is built for Indian GST and generates GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B data, supports e-invoicing through the Invoice Registration Portal and e-way bill generation, and pulls GSTR-2B for input credit matching. Filing still needs human review, because credit mismatches and supplier non filing have to be resolved outside the software before the return is submitted on the GST portal.</p></div>
</div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">Can Zoho Books connect to a bank, payment gateway and online store?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Yes. Zoho Books supports automatic bank feeds from most major Indian banks, connects to Razorpay, Stripe and PayPal for collections, and integrates with Shopify, Amazon and WooCommerce through native or third party connectors. Marketplace settlements are imported at gross value with commission, shipping and tax collected at source recorded separately, so revenue is never understated.</p></div>
</div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">What are the options for a business in India still running QuickBooks?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Intuit withdrew QuickBooks from India in 2023 and support for Indian subscribers ended, so the practical route is migration to another platform, most commonly Zoho Books. We export your masters, balances and transaction history, map the chart of accounts, rebuild the GST settings for Indian rules and reconcile the opening trial balance before go live. Old data is archived in readable form.</p></div>
</div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">After setup, who maintains the books, your team or ours?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Either model works. Many clients take a full monthly retainer where our team posts entries, reconciles banks, files GST and TDS and issues the MIS, typically from Rs 8,000 a month. Others keep data entry in house and use us for month end review, reconciliation and compliance. The access model is fixed at onboarding with role based Zoho Books users on each side.</p></div>
</div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">Is staff training on Zoho Books provided, and what support follows go live?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Training is two live sessions of about 90 minutes each, one covering invoicing and expense entry and one covering reports, banking and approvals, followed by a recorded walkthrough and a written process note specific to your setup. Post go live support runs for 30 days over chat and call, after which support continues within the monthly retainer.</p></div>
</div>
                    <div class="faq-expanded__item">
  <h3 class="faq-expanded__q">Zoho Books or Tally Prime: which one suits a business better?</h3>
  <div class="faq-expanded__a"><p>Choose Zoho Books if you want cloud access, automatic bank feeds, e-commerce and payment gateway integrations and multiple users working from different locations. Choose Tally Prime if you carry complex inventory with godown level tracking, have an established in house entry team and prefer an offline file. Zoho Books usually costs less overall once hosting and licence renewals are counted.</p></div>

                <p><strong>Quick Answers</strong></p>
                <p>A ledger left on default settings produces returns that will not reconcile: tax rates sit on the wrong heads, credit notes lose their link to the original invoice, and the outward supply upload fails validation at the portal. So the work is configuration first and routine second. Masters are corrected, historical.</p>

                <p style="color:rgba(255,255,255,0.88);">Every return cycle your team exports the ledger to Excel, fixes the same handful of columns and uploads from there, then repeats it next month. A Zoho Books accountant removes that detour by making the software itself the record of authority, so exports become a report you read rather than a file you correct.</p>
<p style="color:rgba(255,255,255,0.88);">Reconciling the bank by hand, line against line, stops being anybody&#x27;s monthly chore once a sound Zoho Books setup lets feeds and matching rules handle the routine pass. The knowledge of how the ledger was built also stops living with one employee, which matters when that employee moves on.</p>
<p style="color:rgba(255,255,255,0.88);">Your Zoho edition is reviewed first, along with how many organisations sit inside it and whether invoices originate in Zoho Books or a separate billing tool that feeds it. Migrations from Tally, or a comparison against a <a href="/xero-accounting">multi-currency ledger on Xero</a>, are examined then too.</p>
